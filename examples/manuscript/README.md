This directory contains the code needed to run the experiments in Puolam√§ki et al. (2019), see
the [main readme file](https://github.com/edahelsinki/corand/) for a reference.

You can run the experiments, e.g., by opening the file [`hgde_experiments.Rmd`](https://github.com/edahelsinki/corand/blob/master/examples/manuscript/hgde_experiments.Rmd) in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/),
see the [instructions](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html).
